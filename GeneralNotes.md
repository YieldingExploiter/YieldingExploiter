# General Notes
stuff I put when I need to quickly mention something to someone, and don't want to explain it 20 times.

###### Stuff formatted like this is so I can get a link to the desired paragraph using stuff like #1a

## AstolfoBrew
###### s1

### "Obfuscation is horrible for the Free-Software (also known as the Open-Source-Software) Community!"
###### 1a
In most cases, I agree. But if you're developing an exploit for a Roblox game, or similar stuff, it is useful to not require a full recode every time the game updates.<br/>
I strongly encourage you to provide the source to anyone who asks for it.

### "AstolfoBrew obfuscation is Bad and Luraph's development team exposed it"
###### 1b
I rarely look at AstolfoBrew's Backend (at all), and just use it as a submodule for my AstolfoBrew API. This explains some of the dumb claims I made.<br/>
I also don't really know a lot about **lua obfuscation** (I don't know a lot about the technical portions of Lua), and don't need to, as I don't actively work on the C# and Rust Backends (see [1c](#1c)) of AstolfoBrew

### "Wait, AstolfoBrew has several backends? WHY?"
###### 1c
(this is what I understood from a newer conversation with the Project Lead, Mokiy, and might not be fully correct. However, I know that there are 2 backends, considering my web-API calls both independently)<br/>
We have a Rust program (no fork of anything, entirely made by Mokiy - uses a fork of [Full Moon](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/full-moon) for parsing iirc) do some initial light-weight\* obfuscation on the source code, aswell as compress all strings in the source that are longer than `x` characters (not sure what number `x` is atm).
Then we feed the output into our heavily modified IB2 fork, and send you the output.

\*as in non-VM-based obfuscation - for the record, **this doesn't mean we use loadstring**, since we do not, and never will use vanilla `loadstring`.

### "AstolfoBrew can be used to distribute Malware!!!"
###### 1d
That is true, but we take actions against users that do not comply with our Terms (TODO: ADD LINK TO TERMS), which include that you may not distribute any form of malware.

### "How can you trust AstolfoBrew to not add malicious code to my obfuscated output, like KFC Obfuscator did?\*"
###### 1e
You can simply check the typical function calls that we would make (ie `game:HttpGet()`, `game:HttpGetAsync()`, `game:GetService('HttpService'):GetAsync()`, etc...) by replacing them with wrappers that log shit. The result? Nothing you didn't add into the source script.

\* If you used an obfuscator called fucking KFC, go back to eating actual KFC 24/7.

### "You use a Full-Moon fork? Does that mean that full-moon bugs also appear in the Production builds of AstolfoBrew?"
###### 1f
Yes, although we fix a lot of them ourselves, and a lot more get fixed moderately quickly for us.<br/>
Please do not contact me for Full-Moon parsing issues within astolfobrew though, as that's not my responsibility :P<br/>
(ask literally any other contributor instead)

## Personal shit
###### s2

### "In a previous variant of this file, you mentioned you knew nothing about obfuscators, yet are a reverse engineer"
###### 2z
Please see the details of the message for [`b1235a5`](https://github.com/YieldingExploiter/YieldingExploiter/commit/b1235a548c34217931eae0121af452413e98dcc9).

(this is #2z because I will likely remove this soon once that commit is lost behind 20 billion others, and I don't want to shift everything once I add more to this section and break all existing links - it's only here to avoid people asking in the first place anyway)


## I will update this whenever necesary
