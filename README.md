### Hi there üëã
Hi, I'm YieldingCoder, a Reverse-Engineer and, in general, Computer Scientist.

#### My take on Open-Source Software
I ‚ô•Ô∏è OSS. And I don't mean that in a Discord "omg i love OSS shit lmao kekw" type of way - I legitimately like it and enjoy making Open-Source Software.

In general, I've started to move towards making open-source code, as to promote freedom for the end user.<br/>
-> Does this mean AstolfoBrew will become open-source? No.<br/>
-> Does this mean AstolfoBrew Script Protection will become worse? Also no.<br/>
-> Does this mean I discourage using AstolfoBrew for anything it isn't pretty necesary for (ie still using it preventing game develoeprs from being able to read your scripts' source code and patch the script(s), but not things like general IP Protection)? Yes.

I generally open-source code once it's close to a release stage, which is why 95% of my code is closed-source. (I'm too lazy to create a new repository every time I want to write some code)

If you find some closed-source code on this github account (ie pre-compiled), please ask me for the source. I might not publicly make it available for specific reasons, but in general will provide it to people who ask.

#### Why I don't use git remotes (/the git CLI)...
##### ...and use GitHub's UI instead
I don't use git remotes as I've leaked personal info by accidentally pushing shit I didn't mean to one too many times.

P.S. to Melancholy and whoever else is on the Luraph Dev Team is stalking every one of my v3rmillion posts to check if im mentioning obfuscators and tryna make me look bad, nice one, you're totally not making yourself look bad by injecting yourself into things that are [barely even related to either one of our products](https://v3rmillion.net/showthread.php?pid=8063408#pid8063408).<br/>
-> It totally makes you look good, continue doing it!<br/>
P.P.S. Nice job deleting your Luraph thread!
